        <h2><u>Understand web3 – the first resources</u></h2>

        <p><b>Get ready for web3 in a couple of hours!</b><br>
            In the following, we share some beginner’s resources to make yourself familiar with the concept and decide if it’s worth the hype. (-:

        <h3>1. The background of distributed systems: read <a href=https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html>the Cypherpunk's Manifesto</a> (1993, Eric Hughes)</h3>
        <p>The “cypherpunk manifesto” was written by Eric Hughes already 30 years ago. It is one of the key contributions of the so-called “cypherpunk” movement, often referred to as the ideological background to Bitcoin and later web3.<br><br>
            The cypherpunks were known as a group from the early 90s on, incorporating both “cypher” and “punk” in their name. They strongly advocated the value of privacy in the upcoming digital age. One of the main tools to defend privacy would be the use of encryption methods and open-source software.<br><br>
            The group especially emphasized the need for anonymity in digital transaction systems (compared to cash in the real world), since it's one of the most sensible areas regarding one’s privacy. More than a decade later, Bitcoin was the first widely used system to fulfil this “cypherpunk dream”. Read more in the Bitcoin whitepaper. <br><br>

        <h3>2. Understand distributed systems: read <a href=https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274>The Meaning of Decentralization</a> (2017, Vitalik Buterin)</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin was also the first large-scale application of blockchain technology. Transactions are processed in time-stamped data packages called “blocks”, that are periodically added to the database. One of the key characteristics of a blockchain is, that this database consists of many geographically distributed computers (“nodes”) – building a “decentralized” network.<br><br>
            The article by Vitalik Buterin explains decentralization: he identifies three different axes of (de)centralization: architectural decentralization describes, how the computers of a network are physically distributed and how many of them can fall out while still maintaining the network. Political decentralization, on the other hand, refers to how many individuals or organizations these computers are controlled. <br><br>
            Finally logical decentralization refers to the question whether the network rather is a “monolithic object” or an “amorphous swarm”. In conclusion, blockchains would be characterized as architecturally and politically decentralized, or at least this is the preferred state, while they are not logically decentralized.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>3. The road to web3: read <a href=https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters>Why decentralization matters</a> (2018, Chris Dixon)</h3>
        <p>After understanding the concept of decentralization, we can go to the question, o why decentralization is beneficial, and how this leads us to web3. The term generally refers to the next iteration of the internet, where it becomes more decentralized and controlled by its users, by using blockchain technology to enable users to interact and transact more securely and transparently. <br><br>
            The development of the three internet "generations" is often characterized by the phrase "read - write - own". The web1 from the 1980s onwards was mainly characterized by static websites ("write"), built on open protocols that were controlled by the internet community. In contrast, web2 stands for new possibilities of interaction through large platform economies, parallel to the emergence of social media and mobile devices ("write"). These services became very successful, to the point that it is hard to use the internet to avoid centralized services.<br><br>
            The "web3" promises a return to the open-source culture of web1 and a departure from the platform models of web2. Users can not only participate but are also part of the infrastructure ("own"). While the services look similar, they are powered by smart contracts in the background and accessible via a wallet instead of credentials or social networks.<br><br>
            We hope you got an understanding of the term “web3” and its background. Check the <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/08/crypto-glossary/">a16z crypto glossary</a> or this <a href=https://medium.com/@NewForum/crypto-80-a-new-dictionary-e18e45fb3f16>crypto dictionary</a> to get some vocabulary and learn the web3 “language”. <br><br>
